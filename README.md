This is my first attempt at writing a Lisp interpreter.
It's not going to conform to any standard - I'm making it up as I go.
In fact, it's probably going to miss just about every feature that makes a Lisp a Lisp.

Pretty much the entire codebase is commentless and repetitive. You've been warned.

- Lexer - Done
- Parser - Done
- Interpreter - Not done


Building
--------
I have not written the interpreter yet. To build and run the lexer and parser demos, run:
`make tests`
